## Technologies

- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-End:** Node.js, Express.js, MySQL
- **MySQL vs. PostgreSQL:**  
  MySQL is well-suited for read-heavy operations and has a simpler setup, whereas PostgreSQL offers more advanced features and better support for complex queries. MySQL was chosen for its ease of use and performance in handling the app's expected workload.

## Challenges

### Challenge Statement

- **Problem:**  
  QTM aims to solve the problem of disorganized time management by providing users with a clear weekly summary of their performance against their goals.

- **Limitations:**  
  The app will not provide detailed daily feedback or integrate with other task management tools like Trello or Asana.

- **Target Users:**  
  The app is designed for busy professionals and students who need a simple yet effective way to manage their time and tasks.

- **Locale Relevance:**  
  The app is universal and not dependent on a specific locale, making it suitable for global users.

## Risks

### Technical Risks

- **Risk:**  
  Scalability issues with MySQL.
  
- **Impact:**  
  Could lead to slower performance as the user base grows.
  
- **Safeguards:**  
  Implement database sharding and indexing strategies.

### Non-Technical Risks

- **Risk:**  
  User adoption and retention.
  
- **Impact:**  
  Low user engagement could lead to the project's failure.
  
- **Strategies:**  
  Conduct user surveys and beta testing to ensure the app meets user needs.

## Infrastructure

### Branching and Merging

Any additions to the team will use GitHub Flow, creating feature branches for all new work and merging into the main branch after code reviews.

### Deployment Strategy

The QTM - Quality Time Management app will be deployed using a multi-tier architecture to ensure scalability and reliability. The application will be containerized with Docker, facilitating consistent environments across development, testing, and production. For serving the app, nginx will act as the web server, handling client requests and providing load balancing. Flask will be used to serve the app, while Apache will manage static content and enhance performance. Deployment will be orchestrated through a CI/CD pipeline integrated with GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment processes. This strategy ensures a smooth deployment workflow and the ability to scale the app efficiently as user demand grows.

### Data Population

Data will be populated through a combination of user input and integration with third-party APIs for time management and task tracking.

### Testing Tools

- **Unit Testing:**  
  `unittest` - Python's built-in testing framework will be used for writing and running unit tests to ensure individual components of the app function correctly.

## Existing Solutions

### Similar Products

- **Todoist:**
